# Data-Science-Projects
The Gini index (also called the Gini coeficient) is a measure of inequality, most often used to
describe income inequality in populations. In this project you multiple regression is used 
to model the Gini index across countries. The goal is to understand which factors might be
related to income inequality and how. 

The data is provided by the World Bank to determine which explanatory variables to
include (link to all World Bank data: http://data.worldbank.org; and also a link to Gini
index data: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI). (This data requires
a lot of cleaning.)

The project is followed by the given below sequence:
Executive Summary: short paragraph summarizing the paper (this is like the business
version of the abstract in the Arregle, et al paper).
1 Introduction: define the Gini index and the purpose of the study

2 Data: source of your data; discuss which 10 explanatory variables you considered and
why (not just the ones you ended up including in your final model); relevant summary
information about the explanatory and response variables; which countries are included
in your data set; which year(s) are included in your data set; how you cleaned your
data

3. Methods: relevant plots; model building summary (transformations, variable selection,
collinearity, etc.); check regression assumptions (for now, leave out multicollinearity
and autocorrelation since we haven't discussed those topics yet); model evaluation;
relevant hypothesis tests (include hypotheses, test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value,
@(alpha) value and conclusion)

4. Discussion: final regression model; interpretation of model; discussion of usefulness of
model; any ideas you have for improvement
